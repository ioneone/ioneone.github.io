<p>If you don't believe in the principle of reciprocity, let me tell you this‚Äîit's real. I don't have a car, so I usually go grocery by bike. It takes quite some amount of time (takes about 30-45 mins total). My housemates have cars, so when they offer to give me a ride, I greatly appreciate their kindness because it saves me tons of time and energy. When they need a help, I would recall the times they helped doing this and that, so I want to help them back. You see, this is very powerful. You are essentially trading your time and effort for things you would not be able to gain otherwise by yourself.</p>
<h3>"Over time, I came to see reaching out to people as a way to make a difference in people‚Äôs lives as well as a way to explore and learn and enrich my own"</h3>
<p>This is a good mindset to keep in mind when reaching out to people around you. You have something to learn from <em>every</em> person you meet. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." Why? Every single person has 24 hours a day. What differentiates us is how we allocate these finite hours. Every hour I spend watching Computer Architechture lecture makes me superior than some people in the field of Computer Science. In return, I becomes inferior to someone who just spent an hour talking with their friends in terms of networking. It's all about the trade off, just like the trade off between space and time complexities of algorithms.</p>
<h3>"I learned that real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get."</h3>
<p>I don't attend many events on campus. One of the reasons is because my day is over whenever I finish all my assignments, and another set of homework is assigned the next day. Another reason is because I have tendency to look for things <em>I</em> can learn when I look for events to go. If I won't learn anything from the event, I won't go. Although it's time efficient in my opinion, Ferrazzi argues this is not the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>Instead, you go to events to help. Then, by the principle of reciprocity, you make new connections and they will help you in return when the time comes.</p>
<h3>"He thought of relationships as finite, like a pie that can be cut into only so many pieces. Take a piece away, and there was that much less for him. I knew, however, that relationships are more like muscles‚Äîthe more you work them, the stronger they become."</h3>
<p>A lesson to learn‚Äîdo not keep the score.</p>
<h3>"The more specific you are about what you want to do, the easier it becomes to develop a strategy to accomplish it. Part of that strategy, of course, is establishing relationships with the people in your universe who can help you get where you‚Äôre going."</h3>
<p>Know exactly what you want, and look for the opportunity (i.e. people to help you).</p>
<h3>"A goal is a dream with a deadline."</h3>
<p>My goal is to have net worth 1 million dollars by the age of 30!</p>
<h3>"Have you ever sat down and thought seriously about what you truly love? What you‚Äôre good at? What you want to accomplish in life? What are the obstacles that are stopping you? Most people don‚Äôt. They accept what they ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing, rather than take the time to figure out what they want to be doing."</h3>
<p>This reminds me of the principle I learned from <em>The 4 Hour Workweek</em>. I put things I <em>want</em> to do in the morning no matter what‚Äîreading books, learning Python, learning English. Then I move on and finish tasks I <em>should</em> be doing‚Äîhomework. I thought I'm losing time and will not be able to finish my homework on time. But it doesn't work that way. Have you ever had an experience where you forgot there is an 4-page essay due, and finish it just in a day? When we have less time, we unconsciously use every minute of our time as efficiently as possible. We are less likely to procrastinate and end up watching videos on Youtube. Do what you <em>want</em> to do in the morning, then do what you <em>should</em> do the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Note: Don't spend your entire day doing what you <em>want</em> to do and discard what you <em>should</em> do. I'm saying you should prioritize what you <em>want</em> to do over what you <em>should</em> do. As the deadline for what <em>should</em> do approaches, you should flip the priorities.</p>
<h3>"The great myth of networking is that you start reaching out to others only when you need something like a job. In reality, people who have the largest circle of contacts, mentors, and friends know that you must reach out to others long before you need anything at all."</h3>
<p>You reach out to your network of people before you need them. Like mentioned in earlier quote, relationship is like a mustle. It grows as you work it out. So what do you do when you reach out to your circle? Well, you talk to them, ask how their life is going, and see if you can help them in any way. Real networking is about finding a way to help others. Always keep in mind the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<h3>"If you are informed enough to step comfortably into their world and talk knowledgeably, their appreciation will be tangible. As William James wrote: The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated."</h3>
<p>As discussed in <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, we are all craving for appreciation. If you know well enough about your friends, you know what topics intrigue them. There is a saying: To be interested, be interesting. How to be interesting? You appreciate. You need to do your homework and learn what people value. Then you talk about that. You don't appreciate/talk about things they don't care.</p>
<h3>"Building a network of friends and colleagues is about building relationships and friendships. It should be fun, not time-consuming."</h3>
<p>I agree it's logical to think that building a relationship requires a lot of time commitment, and you don't get an immediate return from it (you shouldn't expect one). Here's how I would rationalize the action. Think of relashionship buildings as a long-term investment like index funds. Over the long run, you make money from it, so it's worth the time commitment.</p>
<h3>"The same principle holds true in growing your web of relationships. The bigger it gets, the more attractive it becomes, and the faster it grows. That‚Äôs why I say that a network is like a muscle‚Äîthe more you work it, the bigger it gets."</h3>
<p>People introduce people. The more people you know, the more new people you get.</p>
<h3>"Friendship is created out of the quality of time spent between two people, not the quantity."</h3>
<p>I think <code>(friendship) = (avg quality) x (quantity)</code>. Not just the quality.</p>
<h3>"It is what you do together that matters, not how often you meet. That‚Äôs why you have to pay special attention to where you‚Äôre most comfortable and what activities you most enjoy."</h3>
<p>To improve the quality of the time you spend with people, you must genuinely enjoy the moment. So don't try to go to every possible event, but just attend the one you think you will have fun.</p>
<h3>"He is finely tuned in to the radio station that we each listen to, WIIFM, also known as What‚Äôs in It for Me?"</h3>
<p>As mentioned in <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, the only thing we actually care about is ourselves. Everyone is always asking WIIFM in their head. So if you can talk from their perspective (i.e. talk about what they care), they will like you.</p>
<h3>"the power of the vulnerability principle in the art of making small talk."</h3>
<p>As Ferrazzi argues, if you open up your vulnerability, say you had a divorce, then the other person will start to talk about the time when they failed. This principle is similar to the principle of reciprocity. Someone just shared their vulnerability/story, which makes you want to share your side of story in return. This keeps the conversation going.</p>
<h3>"The real winners‚Äîthose with astounding careers, warm relationships, and unstoppable charisma‚Äîare those people who put it all out there and don‚Äôt waste a bunch of time and energy trying to be something (or someone) they‚Äôre not. Charm is simply a matter of being yourself. Your uniqueness is your power. We are all born with innate winning traits to be a masterful small talker."</h3>
<p>You are boring when you try to be someone you are not. You are more interesting when you are being yourself.</p>
<h3>"When you help someone through a health issue, positively impact someone‚Äôs personal wealth, or take a sincere interest in their children, you engender life-bonding loyalty."</h3>
<p>Here's the reasons according to Ferrazzi:</p>
<ul>
<li>You help someone fulfill those needs they most need met.</li>
<li>You allow them the opportunity to move up the pyramid of needs to tackle some of their higher desires.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, the pyramid refers to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.</p>

<h3>How to Build A Network</h3>
<p>There are three types of people:</p>
<ol>
<li>Givers: Help people without expectation of any return</li>
<li>Takers: Take away resources and time from others</li>
<li>Matchers: Give as much as they get (i.e. score keepers)</li>
</ol>
<p>You must be a particular type of giver‚Äîa giver who is strategic about their giving.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give to Givers: Don't waste too much of your time and energy on takers. Since takers don't ever give back, it's simply a waste of resources. Building a friendship is about giving your time and energy, so choose who you give your resources to.</li>
<li>Feed Your Network First: Nurture your network first before trying to expand it. In other words, value the quality of the network rather than the size.</li>
<li>Give Before They Ask: Don't wait to be asked. Just do it.</li>
<li>Look for Bargains: Some favors only take 5 minutes (e.g. recommendations, forwarding resources, answering questions, etc.). You must take advantage of this social arbitrage‚Äîlittle cost to you while high return to others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"Is it what you know or who you know that leads to success? For Burt, it‚Äôs both. Who you know determines how effectively you can apply what you know."</h3>
<p><code>(Success) = (What You Know) x (Who You Know)</code></p>
<h3>"Performing social arbitrage when your financial and relational resources are thin is actually not too big a hurdle. The solution is knowledge, one of the most valuable currencies in social arbitrage. Knowledge is free‚Äîit can be found in books, in articles, on the Internet, pretty much everywhere, and it‚Äôs precious to everyone."</h3>
<p>This is most likely what I need to do. My financial and relational resources are pretty thin at the moment, but I have abundance about Computer Science, budgeting, and investing.</p>
<h3>"People pay attention when they feel they‚Äôre receiving intel that‚Äôs specifically tailored for them; the more granularly you can target, the better."</h3>
<p>I will be creating contents specifically tailored for Software Engineers.</p>
<h3>"Standard advice on acknowledging the events in people‚Äôs lives suggests sending Christmas or Chanukah cards. The holidays, in my opinion, are not the best time to focus your pinging energies. Why? Because it‚Äôs hard to differentiate yourself from the other 150 people doing the same thing. My personal favorite pinging occasion remains birthdays."</h3>
<p>Put your friends' birthdays on your calendar.</p>
<h3>"You can similarly design your own life to maximize serendipity, with a little awareness. You‚Äôll have to leave time on your schedule for things that in the moment may seem so far removed from your immediate goals that they seem silly‚Äîa trip to the park, coffee with an old classmate, going left when you would normally go right. Say yes to new experiences when you would normally say no."</h3>
<p>How to get lucky? You need to put yourself in a position to maximize the probablity of running into a luck.</p>
<h3>"Virtually everyone new you meet in a situation is asking themselves a variation on one question: 'Would I want to spend an hour eating lunch with this person?'"</h3>
<p>Be interested in others.</p>
<h3>"The trick is not to work obsessively on the skills and talents you lack, but to focus and cultivate your strengths so that your weaknesses matter less. I‚Äôd apply the 80/20 rule, in that you should spend some time getting better at your weaknesses but really focus on building your strengths."</h3>
<p>I will spend 80% of my time into learning Computer Science. The rest of 20% goes to personal development, financing, relationship buildings, etc.</p>
<h3>"Most people‚Äôs judgments and impressions are based on visuals‚Äîeverything other than the words you speak that communicates to others what you‚Äôre about. For everyone in every field‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real‚Äîimage counts, so whatever your look, take time to think it through ... Style matters. Whether you like it or not, clothing, letterheads, hairstyles, business cards, office space, and conversational style are noticed‚Äîbig time."</h3>
<p>Care about your appearence.</p>
<h3>"But as my father taught me, mentors are all around you. It‚Äôs not necessarily your boss or even someone in your business. Mentoring is a nonhierarchical activity that transcends careers and can cross all organizational levels. A CEO can learn from a manager, and vice versa. Some smart companies, recognizing this fact, actually have programs in place that view new hires as mentors to the company. After a month on the job, they‚Äôll ask these new employees to jot down all their impressions with the idea that a fresh pair of eyes can see old problems and make innovative suggestions that others can‚Äôt. In fact, the people I‚Äôve learned so much from are my own young mentees, who help me periodically to update my skills and view the world anew."</h3>
<ol>
<li>"Mentoring is a nonhierarchical activity" is mind blowing to me. I was thinking mentoring is all about mentees learning from mentors, and there aren't much in it for the mentors. Everyone is a mentor and also a mentee at the same time.</li>
<li>I wish I read this quote before my summer intern 2020. Towards the end of the internship, my manager and colleage asked me if there is any improvement for the code base. I was focusing too much on completing my tasks well and did not pay too much attention about the usability of the code base. So I just said I wished there were more comments in the code, but everything else seemed fine.</li>
</ol>
<h3>"There are those who don‚Äôt get it at first. They sheepishly ask, 'How can I ever repay you for all that you are doing?' I tell them they‚Äôre repaying me now. All I really expect is sincere gratitude, and to see them apply all that they are learning."</h3>
<p>This quote is in the context of new hires learning from their managers. Dear my manager, you are probably not looking at this, but I greatly appreciate that you decided to hire me. I will do my best in the job:)</p>
<h3>"I can‚Äôt stress enough how powerful the process is and how important it is that you give your respect and time to it. In return, you‚Äôll be more than compensated with spirit, enthusiasm, trust, and empathy‚Äîall things that will ultimately far exceed the value of any advice you gave."</h3>
<p>One day you will be a mentor. This is the quote you should keep in mind.</p>
<h3>"Not many. People need 'refrigerator rights relationships,' the kind that are comfortable, informal, and intimate enough to let us walk into one another‚Äôs kitchens and rummage through the refrigerator without asking. It is close relationships like these that keep us well adjusted, happy, and successful."</h3>
<p>It's well known that money doesn't make you happy (although it certainly helps) but the human relashionship does. Note it's not just any relashionship. You should aim for refrigerator rights relationships.</p>
<h3>"Wherever you are in life right now, and whatever you know, is a result of the ideas, experiences, and people you have interacted with in your life, whether in person, through books and music, e-mail, or culture. There is no score to keep when abundance leads to even more abundance. So make a decision that from this day forward you will start making the contacts and accumulating the knowledge, experiences, and people to help you achieve your goals."</h3>
<p>This contradicts with the 80/20 rule mentioned earlier. Creating new contacts is not my strength. So I will do my best in those 20% of my time.</p>
<h3>"From my own experience, I can tell you the answers will come as a surprise. What‚Äôs important probably won‚Äôt come down to a job, a company, or a cool new piece of technology. It will come down to people. It‚Äôs up to each of us, working together with people we love, to make the world a world we want to live in."</h3>
<p>Make your work environemnt full of people you like. Open up your vulnerability. Seek for help. And give back.</p></div></div><div style="height:64px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div></div><div style="flex-basis:64px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div><div style="height:128px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div><style data-emotion-css="m1qqhv">.css-m1qqhv{-webkit-flex-basis:160px;-ms-flex-preferred-size:160px;flex-basis:160px;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;}</style><div class="css-m1qqhv"><div class="css-0"><style data-emotion-css="1rb1sh8">.css-1rb1sh8{display:block;}@media (max-width:960px){.css-1rb1sh8{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;}}</style><div class="css-1rb1sh8"><div><style data-emotion-css="1354mfx">.css-1354mfx{object-fit:cover;width:96px;display:block;border-radius:50%;}</style><img src="/profile.png" alt="profile" class="css-1354mfx"/></div><div style="flex-basis:32px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div><div style="height:32px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div><div><style data-emotion-css="r44k6v">.css-r44k6v{margin:0;}</style><h3 class="css-r44k6v">Junhong Wang</h3><div style="height:8px;flex-grow:0;flex-shrink:0;display:block"></div><div>Software Engineer.
