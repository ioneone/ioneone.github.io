<p>My take on this is that if you are doing something for the first time, don't expect that you can do it perfectly. Expect failures, but do not give it up. As from the law of 10,000 hours rule from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers</a>, you need to put significant amount of time to be proficient in anything. So don't give up. Fake it until you make it.</p>
<h3>"The Power of Desire"</h3>
<p>With a burning desire, you can achieve anything. When you face challenges, instead of saying you can't overcome it, think about <em>how</em> you can overcome. The brain is the most sophisticated computer in the world.</p>
<p>For example, when I first learned about investing, I thought there were super complicated. It took like forever for me to understand 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, capital gain, taxable income, ... etc. But I had (and still have!) the obsession to become rich. So I kept learning on Google seraches, watched hundreds and hundreds of Youtube videos about it, until I get it.</p>
<p>A strong desire forces you to come up with ways to obtain what you want. I didn't know anything about investing 6 months ago. Now, I do.</p>
<h3>"Knowledge has no value except that which can be gained from its application toward some worthy end."</h3>
<p>Think actually makes sense now that I think about it. I used to think why it was so hard for me to find internships as a student from a prestigious school. I had this illusion that somehow being a student at UCLA and completing classes makes me worthy. I was wrong. Recruiters are looking for people who can get the work done using their specialized knowledge. They are not looking for people who have the most specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>I think this is why students from clubs like ACM or DevX have lots and lots of internship experience. They have cool projects and leadership experience to show off that they know how to use their CS knowledge.</p>
<h3>"Those who are not successful usually make the mistake of believing that the knowledge acquiring period ends when one finishes school. The truth is that schooling does little more than to put one in the way of learning how to acquire practical knowledge."</h3>
<p>UCLA is known for providing theoretical CS courses than practical. I used to think that UCLA should offer more practical courses that teach Web Development and iOS App Development. But in a sense UCLA gave me a solid foundation in Computer Science, which I wouldn't have been able to gain by myself. If you are a CS student, you proabaly have noticed, for example, there aren't much resources on the Web about Computer Networking. On the other hand, practical knowledges such as React and Python courses are all over the place.</p>
<p>The point is, I think I am the one who is responsible for learning practical those practical knowledge myself. School is there just to help me understand the practical knowledge by providing CS theories.</p>
<h3>"Successful men never stop acquiring specialized knowledge related to their major purpose, business, or profession."</h3>
<p>I remember watching one of Youtube video about the difference between the rich and the poor. When the poor comes back from work, they chill and watch the TV. The rich, on the other hand, reads a book or takes an online course to acquire new knowledge.</p>
<p>I probably should have a list of technical books to read before I graduate 🤔.</p>
<h3>"The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the possession of the man who accumulates the fortune."</h3>
<p>You don't need to know it all. You just need to know how to know it.</p>
<p>Manager roles generally get more compensation than other roles like Software Engineer. Why? Well, as Napoleon argues, "the world does not pay men for what they know. It pays them for what they do, or induce others to do." A company does not pay you for what you know. It pays you to create a product/service/feature to generate more revenue. So if you want more compensation, take more responsibility and ownership in the product.</p>
<p>Implementing a feature is hard. Coming up with a feature is hard. A company values the latter.</p>
<h3>"Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as cold-blooded, and sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is will-power, which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure the attainment of their objectives."</h3>
<p>My objective in college is to be smart as much as possible and get a full-time job offer.</p>
<p>I do realize I am not socializing as much as I should. I usually just stay at home and do my homework. By the time I finish the work, the next set of homework is released. I know this is like an excuse but this routine kept me away from social events on compus.</p>
<p>I thought I was cold-blooded, but maybe I was just trying my best to achieve my objective no matter what.</p>
<h3>"Persistence is the direct result of habit."</h3>
<p>I have a strong desire to read books for personal development. In the beginning, I forced myself to the desk and read a book. Now reading a book has been built into my morning routine. I read a book for about 30-60 mins every morning without thinking about it. To be rich, build a good habit. To build a habit, you need to back it up with a strong desire. I wanted to be a better version of myself so badly.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when building a habit is to spend the time for yourself first (similar to the idea of spending the money for yourself first from Rich Dad Poor Dad). Even if I have homework due, I always spend my morning reading a book with a cup of coffee. For me, morning is the secred time where I'm only allowed to do stuff for myself. You might think, "But I don't have to." For that, I tell you, "Figure out a way to finish any work you need to do without sacrificing your morning." You will be amazed (as I was) when you realize you can finish a task quicker than you think, <strong>especially when you are running out of time</strong>.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper—The Principle of Give and Take.</h3>
<p>People help you not only out of good will, but also because they hope you will help them in return when you are in a position to do so. If you want help from people, then you need to impress their gatekeepers so that you will be the first to come to their mind when opportunities arise.</p>
