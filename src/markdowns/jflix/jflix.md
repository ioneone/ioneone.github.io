# Jflix

![jflix](https://github.com/ioneone/Jflix/raw/master/jflix.png)

Jflix is the personal project I built at the end of my publication: Getting Started with GraphQL. This project uses GraphQL and expressJS for the back-end.

The source code is available <a href="[https://github.com/ioneone/Jflix](https://github.com/ioneone/Jflix)" target="_blank">here</a>.

The demo of the project is available <a href="[https://jflix.herokuapp.com/](https://jflix.herokuapp.com/)" target="_blank">here</a> (it's live!).

## Motivation

Sometimes people ask me what I do on the weekends. I tell them I watch TV shows and movies when I'm free. Then they ask me what I watch. I say, "I watch...", then I pause. I can't come up with some names on top of my head. So the idea is to have a list of movies and TV shows I watch available as long as there is an Internet connection. Anytime someone asks me the same question, I can pull out my iPhone and visit Jflix ðŸ˜Ž
