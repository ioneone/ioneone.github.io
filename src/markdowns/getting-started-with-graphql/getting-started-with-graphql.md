# Getting Started with GraphQL

I took a class at UCLA in which the professor invited a guest 
from industry to introduce GraphQL. I thought it's such an 
interesting technology to learn because it changes the way we 
see APIs. I thought it's cool that you can make a query from 
the front-end to get what you want from the server. Since it 
was a pretty new technology, I decided to give back to the 
community by documenting my learning process of GraphQL.

Getting Started with GraphQL consists of 5 parts as follows:

1. [Introduction](https://medium.com/@ionejunhong/getting-started-with-graphql-a1cc7951ef39?source=friends_link&sk=4785daf7f0bc80f7d25150f3a903932d)

2. [Back End](https://medium.com/better-programming/getting-started-with-graphql-5cd8e7c66909?source=friends_link&sk=1ca5c58e69b339b4736f258bb9ba850f)

At the end of this series, I built a web application called Jflix, 
where you can view my favorites movies and TV shows. You can check
out the demo [here](https://jflix.herokuapp.com/). It's live!
