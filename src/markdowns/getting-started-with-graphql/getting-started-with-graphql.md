# Getting Started with GraphQL

I took a class at UCLA in which the professor invited a guest 
from industry to introduce GraphQL. I thought it's such an 
interesting technology to learn because it changes the way we 
see APIs. I thought it's cool that you can make a query from 
the front-end to get what you want from the server. Since it 
was a pretty new technology, I decided to give back to the 
community by documenting my learning process of GraphQL.

Getting Started with GraphQL consists of 5 parts as follows:

At the end of this series, I built a web application called Jflix, 
where you can view my favorites movies and TV shows. You can check
out the demo <a href="https://jflix.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">. It's live!
