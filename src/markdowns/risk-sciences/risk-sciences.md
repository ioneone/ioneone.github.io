## Overview

Joined Risk Sciences Lab at UCLA as a 
student developer to design, prototype, 
and build a internal software for system 
reliability analysis for NASA's JPL. Worked 
as a developer as well as a UI designer on 
variety of features. Invented a tree 
traversal algorithm for Human Failure 
Analysis. Continued as a member of the 
lab after the internship, then attended 
meetings and discussed new features to 
implement.

## About

The B. John Grarrik Institute for The Risk 
Sciences (GIRS) is a research lab at UCLA 
that studies the quantification and 
management of the risk of complex natural 
and engineered systems and processes.

## Period

2018 July - 2018 September (intern)

2018 September - PRESENT (part-time)

## Role

![hcla](https://github.com/ioneone/ioneone.github.io/blob/develop/src/markdowns/risk-sciences/hcla.png?raw=true)

I officially joined GIRS as a student 
researcher, but the actual work was more 
like a front-end software developer. At 
GIRS, I was developing a system reliability 
analysis web application (HCLA) for NASA’s 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). I worked 
there during school year for part-time, and 
full-time during the summer.

## HCLA

I only had limited experience in web 
development, and also had no prior 
experience with React. The first few 
weeks in the lab, I spent time just 
learning React, and tweaking the design 
of small things (e.g. button) slightly.

During the summer, I was more confident with 
my skills in React and started to work on 
core features of the app such as Fault Tree 
Modeling using MxGraph.

One of the most challenging features I 
implemented is node value setting page, 
where users can input data into a node.

## Phoenix

Recently, I am also working on the 
development of Phoenix, a human 
reliability analysis web application 
for Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority. 
These two applications look similar because 
they are both built on top of the same 
library we are building.

## Contribution

* Develop a system reliability analysis web application for NASA’s JPL with React
* Develop a human reliability analysis web application for Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority with React
* Enable probabilistic risk modeling techniques to be applied in the different individual domains of the system from traditional techniques using Excel sheets
* Build user interfaces for event modeling using mxGraph
* Migrate 80% of the code base from JavaScript to TypeScript
