LinksIn is my group project for CS 188 (Scalable Internet Services)
with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phipson-lee/" target="_blank">Phipson Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-tu-b94b83127/" target="_blank">Amy Tu</a>,  and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/otleimat/" target="_blank">Omar Tleimat</a>.

LinksIn is a social networking app that builds upon  the mechanics of networking on Tinder to create an accessible, sociable media outlet for the gaming community. As gamers, users can connect to LinksIn through their existing gaming accounts, swipe through other gamers and players using the Tinder card-swiping mechanism, and connect with new players that might be in the same game as them. Additionally, with LinksIn, players can also create LAN events and invite people within their 'card community' to join and coordinate gaming events together.

Here's the demo of the project.

The goal of this project is to learn how to scale the web application such that it can thousands and thousands of user requests at the same time. Here's what we did to make it scalable:

* [Vertical Scaling](vertical-scaling)
* [Horizontal Scaling](horizontal-scaling)
* [Pagination](pagination)
* [Multiprocess/Multithreading](multiprocess-multithreading)
* [SQL Optimization](sql-optimization)
* [Client-side Caching](client-side-caching)
* [Server-side Caching](server-side-caching)
* [Read-Slaves](read-slaves)
