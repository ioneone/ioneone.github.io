## Overview
Interned at a startup company as an iOS app 
developer to build a product review app
(kind of like Yelp for products). This 
was my first internship where I learned 
a lot about software development cycle 
as well as Swift programming language. 
Built a user profile page with 
follower/followee functionality.

## About

MaruMe is a product discovery and review app. 
It provides a personal space for all the 
information you need to make informed 
purchase decisions.

## Role

I joined MaruMe as an iOS app developer 
intern when I was in community college. 
It was a startup company, so I worked 
directly with the two co-founders, where 
I got involved in everything from design 
to programming.

## Process

I had no experience in iOS development 
when I joined MaruMe. At first, I was 
just watching Swift tutorials on Udemy.
But after a couple weeks, I was already 
adding new features for the app. I started 
off by tweaking some existing features such 
as changing the design/appearance of buttons.

The largest feature I ended up building was 
the user profile page, which was released in 
version 0.0.16.

This was a huge update because users can now 
see their stuff in one place (they used to 
have to go to setting > posts, or 
setting > wishlist) and follow other users 
just like many other SNS.
