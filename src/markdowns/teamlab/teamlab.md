## Overview

Joined teamLab's iOS app development team 
to create and maintain a shopping app for 
an Japanese electronics retailer (like Best 
Buy in Japan) with 1.5 million users. Worked 
directly with designers and engineers to 
maximize user experience and usability. 
Frequently discussed with my mentor how a 
feature should be implemented. Suggested an 
algorithm for synchronizing data across 
different views.

## Period 

2018 July - 2018 September

## Role

![biccamera](https://github.com/ioneone/ioneone.github.io/blob/develop/src/markdowns/teamlab/biccamera.jpeg?raw=true)

I joined teamLab’s iOS app development team 
and was assigned to BicCamera project. 
BicCamera is one of the largest electronics 
retail chain in Japan, and we were renewing 
their app so that it adapts to modern design 
and has more useful features including 
product recommendations, searching items by 
category, barcode scanning, and so on.

The first few weeks at teamLab was just me 
struggling to understand the huge code base 
and all the tools they use (Slack, Swagger, 
Zeplin, etc). The first task I completed was 
tutorial pages. These pages give the new 
users some ideas about what the app is 
about and how to navigate it.

The next thing I worked on was the skeleton 
views. We show the skeleton items while the 
app loading the data. This gives the user an 
idea that the page is not empty, but it’s 
loading something.

I also updated some of the UI here and there 
to make the user experience more pleasant.
