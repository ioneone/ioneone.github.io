![museum 3d](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/raw/master/images/lightbulb.jpg)

Museum 3D is my group project from CS 174A (Intro to Computer Graphics) with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntran627/" target="_blank">John Tran</a> and Jonathan Liau. The idea of project is to bring the player to a virtual museum. You can go to the museum at home on your bed:) The arts and objects in the museum in inspired by <a href="[https://borderless.teamlab.art/](https://borderless.teamlab.art/)" target="_blank">teamLab's Borderless Museum</a>. I went there when I was an intern at teamLab, and it was amazing! It's like you are in a world of fantasy ðŸ¦„

### Skybox 

![skybox](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/skybox.gif?raw=true)

Skybox is a technique to create an illusion that the world is infinite. Of course, the world is finite in computer graphics, but we can fake it as if it was infinite by making the world (background to be precise) to move *with* you. A skybox is a huge cube with images of the sky on the surfaces. We place the player in the center of the cube. If we don't do anything special, the player can keep moving forward and eventually gets out of the cube. 

```
P is player

|--------|
|   P ---|------> P'
|--------|       

the cube stays
```

But what if we also move the cube the same way the player moves? Then, no matter where the player is in the world, it is placed at the center of the cube, and thus, the player can never reach the end of the world.

```
P is player

|-------|   |-------|
|   P --|---|-> P'  |
|-------|   |-------|

    ------------>
    
the cube moves along the player
```

### Camera

![camera](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/camera.gif?raw=true)

We are in the world of 3D. How do we simulate a camera? In other words, how do we map this 3D scene into 2D view so that we can display it on the computer screen? Well... this involves a lot of math as shown <a href="[http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html)" target="_blank">here</a>. The idea is to come up with a transformation matrix that transforms 3d coordinate of the objects onto the 2d plane of the camera. Note that the camera does not move. To create an illusion that you (the camera) are moving to the *right*, we make the whole world move to the *left*. 

### Water

![water](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/water.gif?raw=true)

The water rendering is very computationally expensive and takes a few steps to generate. The very first simplest thing we can do is to draw a blue plane.

![water1](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/water1.png?raw=true)

Pretty ugly eh? Well, we will make it pretty soon. So what makes water looks like water? Imagine you are holding a glass of water in a forest. If you look at the water surface, you see the reflections of the trees on it. Reflection and transparency is one of the factor that makes water looks like water. We can get the reflection image on the water with a trick. First, we invert the camera pitch and position with respect to y-axis. This effectively gives up a view point from the water's perspective. 

```
C is camera
C' is inverted camera
The arrow represents the camera direction
                          
                       â†™ï¸Ž C  

---\ ----------- /---
    \   water   /
     \---------/ 

                       â†–ï¸Ž C' 
```

Then, we take a snapshot of the scene. In our case, we snapshot most likely contains an image of the sky from the Skybox. Finally, we render this image on the water with a little bit of transparency and blue color.

![water2](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/water2.png?raw=true)

Another property of water is refraction. Imagine you have a glass of water and you are looking at the surface from above. You *can* see the the bottom of the glass. We can get the refraction image by just taking the snapshot of the scene *before* rendering the water (so that you can see take a photo of what's beneath the water). Then we can mix the reflection and refraction image by 50:50 ratio and render it on the water.

![water3](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/water3.png?raw=true)

Imagine you went to a camp and saw a river. Can you see the bottom of the river? Can you see the sky reflected on it crystal clear? If not, then the river must have some waves. In other words, the water surface is not flat, which makes the reflection and refraction image distorted. We can simulate this by rendering the images with random offset. 

```
Before: image-coord(x1, y1) -> water_coord(x2, y2)
After: image-coord(x1 + random_x, y1_random_y) -> water_coord(x2, y2)
```

![water4](https://github.com/ioneone/Museum-3D/blob/master/images/water4.png?raw=true)

It would be weird when there are waves but no movement. We can move the waves by changing ```random_x``` and ```random_y``` every frame.
