              Hi there! I'm Junhong, a senior year undergraduate student
              at UCLA studying computer science.
              My dream is to become an awesome Software Engineer!
              In the summer of my first year at UCLA,
              I interned as a iOS app developer at teamLab in Japan
              to give myself a feel of what itâ€™s like to be a software engineer.
              I believed itâ€™s important to know beforehand what kind of skills
              I need to become a successful software engineer.
              In my second year at UCLA,
              I started a part-time job as a Software Developer at
              Risk Sciences Lab at UCLA to learn a different stack of technology.
              In particular, I primary focused on learning web front-end development.
              This summer, I will be interning as a Software Engineer at AppFolio
              to enhance their a property management software.
