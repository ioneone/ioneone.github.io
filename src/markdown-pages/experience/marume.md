# iOS App Developer Intern, MaruMe, Jun 2016 - Aug 2016

## Overview

I interned at MaruMe, a startup company based in Berkeley, CA, as an iOS app developer to build a product review app (kind of like Yelp for products).

## 🌟 Highlights

Here are some of stuff I implemented during my summer internship at MaruMe.

### ✍️ Button Redesign

I redesigned the appearence of the buttons so they look nicer.

### 🙍‍♀️ Profile

I created an user profile page where they can review what products they reviewed.
