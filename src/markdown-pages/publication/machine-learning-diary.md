# Machine Learning Diary

In 2018, I started to learn machine learning because it was such a cool topic to learn -- simulating intelligence with computer. I followed Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera as well as some random resources online. I found many machine learning resources online are extremely hard to understand. I documented what I learned and wrote this diary such that it's as easy to understand as possible for everyone. Also, it serves as a reference for me to look back later.

You can find the list of videos of Coursera <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599">here</a>. Technically it is a course offered at Stanford university but the content is almost the same except Stanford's version is more mathematically more rigorous than Coursera version.

Github page to my homework solution of this course is available <a href="https://github.com/ioneone/Coursera-Machine-Learning">here</a>.

I continued learning machine learning for 119 days (almost) in a row. I stopped it because I got to a point, where it is too difficult to understand with undergraduate level math (machine learning is very math heavy!). But I thought I already knew enough about the basic ideas of machine learning, so I called it off. Better spend time on different area of computer science.
