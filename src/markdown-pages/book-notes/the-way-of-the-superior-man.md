## "Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity, which is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles."

The more masculine energy you have, the more you are attracted by people with feminine energy. You must have a mission. A mission is the core of masculine energy. On the other hand, intimate relationships are the core of feminine energy.

My mission is to be a millionaire by age 30 ðŸ˜Ž.
