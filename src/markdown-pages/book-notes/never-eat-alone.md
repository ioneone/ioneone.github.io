### "When you help others, they often help you. _Reciprocity_ is the gussied-up word people use later in life to describe this ageless principle."

If you don't believe in the principle of reciprocity, let me tell you this—it's real. I don't have a car, so I usually go grocery by bike. It takes quite some amount of time (takes about 30-45 mins total). My housemates have cars, so when they offer to give me a ride, I greatly appreciate their kindness because it saves me tons of time and energy. When they need a help, I would recall the times they helped doing this and that, so I want to help them back. You see, this is very powerful. You are essentially trading your time and effort for things you would not be able to gain otherwise by yourself.

### "Over time, I came to see reaching out to people as a way to make a difference in people’s lives as well as a way to explore and learn and enrich my own"

This is a good mindset to keep in mind when reaching out to people around you. You have something to learn from _every_ person you meet. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." Why? Every single person has 24 hours a day. What differentiates us is how we allocate these finite hours. Every hour I spend watching Computer Architechture lecture makes me superior than some people in the field of Computer Science. In return, I becomes inferior to someone who just spent an hour talking with their friends in terms of networking. It's all about the trade off, just like the trade off between space and time complexities of algorithms.

### "I learned that real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get."

I don't attend many events on campus. One of the reasons is because my day is over whenever I finish all my assignments, and another set of homework is assigned the next day. Another reason is because I have tendency to look for things _I_ can learn when I look for events to go. If I won't learn anything from the event, I won't go. Although it's time efficient in my opinion, Ferrazzi argues this is not the right way to think about it.

Instead, you go to events to help. Then, by the principle of reciprocity, you make new connections and they will help you in return when the time comes.

### "He thought of relationships as finite, like a pie that can be cut into only so many pieces. Take a piece away, and there was that much less for him. I knew, however, that relationships are more like muscles—the more you work them, the stronger they become."

A lesson to learn—do not keep the score.

### "The more specific you are about what you want to do, the easier it becomes to develop a strategy to accomplish it. Part of that strategy, of course, is establishing relationships with the people in your universe who can help you get where you’re going."

Know exactly what you want, and look for the opportunity (i.e. people to help you).

### "A goal is a dream with a deadline."

My goal is to have net worth 1 million dollars by the age of 30!

### "Have you ever sat down and thought seriously about what you truly love? What you’re good at? What you want to accomplish in life? What are the obstacles that are stopping you? Most people don’t. They accept what they “should” be doing, rather than take the time to figure out what they want to be doing."

This reminds me of the principle I learned from _The 4 Hour Workweek_. I put things I _want_ to do in the morning no matter what—reading books, learning Python, learning English. Then I move on and finish tasks I _should_ be doing—homework. I thought I'm losing time and will not be able to finish my homework on time. But it doesn't work that way. Have you ever had an experience where you forgot there is an 4-page essay due, and finish it just in a day? When we have less time, we unconsciously use every minute of our time as efficiently as possible. We are less likely to procrastinate and end up watching videos on Youtube. Do what you _want_ to do in the morning, then do what you _should_ do the rest of the day.

Note: Don't spend your entire day doing what you _want_ to do and discard what you _should_ do. I'm saying you should prioritize what you _want_ to do over what you _should_ do. As the deadline for what _should_ do approaches, you should flip the priorities.

### "The great myth of networking is that you start reaching out to others only when you need something like a job. In reality, people who have the largest circle of contacts, mentors, and friends know that you must reach out to others long before you need anything at all."

You reach out to your network of people before you need them. Like mentioned in earlier quote, relationship is like a mustle. It grows as you work it out. So what do you do when you reach out to your circle? Well, you talk to them, ask how their life is going, and see if you can help them in any way. Real networking is about finding a way to help others. Always keep in mind the principle of reciprocity.
