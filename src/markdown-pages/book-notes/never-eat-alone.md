### "When you help others, they often help you. _Reciprocity_ is the gussied-up word people use later in life to describe this ageless principle."

If you don't believe in the principle of reciprocity, let me tell you this—it's real. I don't have a car, so I usually go grocery by bike. It takes quite some amount of time (takes about 30-45 mins total). My housemates have cars, so when they offer to give me a ride, I greatly appreciate their kindness because it saves me tons of time and energy. When they need a help, I would recall the times they helped doing this and that, so I want to help them back. You see, this is very powerful. You are essentially trading your time and effort for things you would not be able to gain otherwise by yourself.

### "Over time, I came to see reaching out to people as a way to make a difference in people’s lives as well as a way to explore and learn and enrich my own"

This is a good mindset to keep in mind when reaching out to people around you. You have something to learn from _every_ person you meet. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." Why? Every single person has 24 hours a day. What differentiates us is how we allocate these finite hours. Every hour I spend watching Computer Architechture lecture makes me superior than some people in the field of Computer Science. In return, I becomes inferior to someone who just spent an hour talking with their friends in terms of networking. It's all about the trade off, just like the trade off between space and time complexities of algorithms.

### "I learned that real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get."
