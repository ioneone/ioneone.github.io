          For our final project, we decided to develop a variation of the viral “Flappy Bird” game on the Nexys 3 board.
          <br>
          The normal game features a bird that must not touch the pipes, which are moving towards it. 
          <br>
          In our variation, the pipes also move up and down, which results in the pipe gap to move. 
          <br>
          The game is displayed on the monitor via VGA connection, and the score is shown on the seven segment display on the board. 
          <br>
          The bird naturally falls down, due to gravity. To keep the bird flying, the user has to move the rightmost switch up (T10). 
          <br>
          The user also can control whether the pipes are moving up and down, via a switch (T9). 
          <br>
          Finally, the game can be reset through a button (D9).
