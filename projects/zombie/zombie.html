          In Zombie Dash, you play the role of Penelope Dolittle, an amateur zombie hunter and professional StarCraft player. 
          <br>
          Your job is to trek through an abandoned building, rescuing frightened citizens before they are turned into brainless, drooling zombies. 
          <br>
          On each level, you must lead all of the citizens safely to the level’s exit(s), 
          <br>
          then head through an exit yourself so you can advance to the next level of the building to save more citizens. If you kill some zombies in the process, that’s even better. 
          <br>
          Once you have saved all of the citizens from every level of the building, the game is over.
