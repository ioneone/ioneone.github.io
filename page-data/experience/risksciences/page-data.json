John Grarrik Institute for The Risk Sciences</a> (GIRS) is a research lab at UCLA that studies the quantification and management of the risk of complex natural and engineered systems and processes. I joined GIRS as a student developer to design, prototype, and build NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's internal software for system reliability analysis.</p>\n<p>Worked as a developer as well as a UI designer on variety of features. Invented a tree traversal algorithm for Human Failure Analysis.</p>\n<h2>🌟 Highlights</h2>\n<p>Here are some of stuff I implemented during my summer internship at GIRS.</p>\n<h3>🌲 Tree Encoding/Decoding</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ioneone/ioneone.github.io/blob/develop/src/markdowns/risk-sciences/editor.png?raw=true\" alt=\"tree\"></p>\n<p>Every tree node has properties such as name, descriptoion, probablity etc. I wrote an encoder to convert the tree objects into JSON format as well as a decoder to do the reverse.</p>\n<h3>✏️ Node Editor</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/ioneone/ioneone.github.io/blob/develop/src/markdowns/risk-sciences/distribution.png?raw=true\" alt=\"editor\"></p>\n<p>I've coded and designed the node editting feature using React.</p>\n<h3>♻️ TypeScript Migration</h3>\n<p>When I joined the lab the code base was 100% JavaScript. To provide type safety and improve the dev devlocity, I've migrated nearly 80% of the code base to TypeScript.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/experience/risksciences"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/experience/risksciences"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
