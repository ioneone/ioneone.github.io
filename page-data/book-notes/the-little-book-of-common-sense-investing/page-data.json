The way to investment success is to get out of the expectations market of stock prices and cast your lot with the real market of business.\"</h3>\n<p>As Warren Buffet once said, \"It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cv54JPN1Ks4/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"graph\"></p>\n<p>If a company is good, it's stock price will generallly grow continously over the long term. The idea is not to be fooled by the market price fluctuation in the short-term, and believe in growth of the stock's intrinsic value in the long-term. If the company is legit, it will grow. That's why S&#x26;P 500 is a good investment option for this strategy because it tracks 500 largest companies in the United States.</p>\n<h3>\"Simply by buying a portfolio that owns shares of every business in the United States and then holding it forever. This simple concept guarantees you will win the investment game played by most other investors who—as a group—are guaranteed to lose.\"</h3>\n<p>Generally there are two types of investment strategy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy cheap and sell high</li>\n<li>Buy and hold</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The former strategy requires an extensive research and carries moderate risks. The latter does not require any research if you invest in index fund and carries low risk in the long-term. I prefer the \"buy and hold\" investment strategy because I can spend my precious time in learning Computer Science.</p>\n<h3>\"Over the long term, the miracle of compounding returns has been overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs.\"</h3>\n<p>We all know the the power of dividend compounding. $100k will worth $1 million in 30 years (assuming S&#x26;P 500's inflation adjusted return is 8% per year). But we also need to be aware that the cost also compounds as well! Here's what you need to look out for when picking an index fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expense Ratio</strong>: Management fee of the fund.</li>\n<li><strong>Sales Loads</strong>: Although the underlining index does not change that often, they do change sometimes. The fund manager would need to sell/buy some shares to reflect the change. The brokage may charge you additional fees for this activity (like commission). Choose an index fund that is also a NTF (no transaction fee) fund. Generally index fund is NTF because shares are distributed directly by the investment company, instead of going through the stock market.</li>\n<li><strong>Turnover Rate</strong>: Percentage of the allocations that is exchanged. You want to minimize this rate as much as possible. When a stock is sold higher than the price you bought, the difference is the capital gain. You will need to pay capital gain tax on this. Another problem with high turnover rate is that you are more likely to be paying for short-term capital gain taxes than long-term capital gain taxes. Generally speaking, 100% turnover would carry a cost of 1% of the assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\"(Bond reduces) the volatility of your portfolio (and gives) you downside protection during large market declines ... the current yield on bonds (3.1 percent) still exceeds the dividend yield on stocks (2 percent).\"</h3>\n<p>This leads me to the notion of <em>2-tier emergency fund</em>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save 3-month living expenses in high yield savings account</li>\n<li>Save 9-month living expenses in bond index fund</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's say you lose your job. You can live off the first 3 months with the savings account. At the same time, you can start gradually selling the bond index fund shares for the 4th month, 5th month, and so on. 1 year should be enough time for you to find your next job.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/book-notes/the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing","title":"Book Notes — The Little Book of Common Sense Investing","description":"This book teaches you how to be rich by investing in low-cost index fund, written by Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard.","thumbnailUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611974789855-9c2a0a7236a3?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-notes/the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3361508366"]}
