On the other hand, if your quality of life decreases by 1% every day, then your quality of life will be only 0.03 (0.99 ^ 365 = 0.03) of it now in a year.</p>\n<p>Just like investing, small improvements in your life compound. Although it's hard to see how such a small change can make a great impact at the moment, over the long run, it will bring a huge impact at the end.</p>\n<h3>\"When we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It‚Äôs the accumulation of many missteps‚Äîa 1 percent decline here and there‚Äîthat eventually leads to a problem.\"</h3>\n<p>Small improvements compound, but so are bad habits. If eat an unhealthy food today, it won't affect you too much. But if you keep eating bad food, one day it will hunt you down.</p>\n<h3>\"Success is the product of daily habits‚Äînot once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\"</h3>\n<p>Success is the result of consistent hard work. Exercise every day. Read a book every day. Study Software Engineering every day. Those little tiny baby steps are the building blocks of your eventual success.</p>\n<h3>\"Relationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.\"</h3>\n<p>Things that compond are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money</li>\n<li>Habits</li>\n<li>Relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\"(Habits) often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it‚Äôs frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn‚Äôt feel like you are going anywhere. It‚Äôs a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed ... But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau‚Äîwhat I call the Plateau of Latent Potential ... When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it‚Äôs the work you did long ago‚Äîwhen it seemed that you weren‚Äôt making any progress‚Äîthat makes the jump today possible.\"</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*iLQ89nhDmku3z3EMgIZI3A.png\" alt=\"plateau\"></p>\n<p>Interestingly, most of the achievements follow this pattern. This agrees with the idea of 10,000-hour rule from the book <em>Outlier</em> by Malcolm Gladwell, which states that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice before you master anything. This translates to approximately 10 years of consistent practice every day for 2-3 hours. Good habits are hard to stick because we don't immediately see the benefits of doing them, especially when you first get started. That's why consistency is so important at the beginning. You want to force yourself to continue your new habits until you reach the threshold. After this threshold, you will be genuinely motivated to make sure habits stick because you can feel the progress by that time.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\"</h3>\n<p>Building habits are important because you will eventually be able to do them without consciously thinking about them.</p>\n<h3>\"Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That‚Äôs the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves ... You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\"</h3>\n<p>When building a habit, you should think about how to build a system that you can stick to. For example, let's say you want to have 6-pack abs. Your mindset should NOT be \"Oh I need to do sit-ups everyday\". Instead, you should be thinking how you can make doing regular sit-ups <strong>part of your life</strong>. Inject a task in-between your already established habits. You already have a habit of taking a shower everyday (or at least I hope you do üôÉ). So maybe you can say \"Okay I will be doing 60 sit-ups everyday before taking a shower\". This is a technique called <strong>Habit Stacking</strong>.</p>\n<h3>\"An atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\"</h3>\n<p>Here's the definition of an atomic habit. It's a building block for your behaviors.</p>\n<h3>\"The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you‚Äôre proud of how your hair looks, you‚Äôll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it ... After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\"</h3>\n<p>Once your habit is part of your life, you don't need to be force yourself to do it. But how do you motivate yourself when you first start out a new habit? Well, you need to have a role model of your new identity associated with that new habit. I've been doing my workout every day without missing a day since summer 2020. I was able to stick with my habit because I want to be the type of a Software Engineer who is fit, healthy, and attractive (don't worry, deep inside I'm still a nerd üëª).</p>\n<h3>\"Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\"</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you need to take a step back and observe your current identity/behaviors from 3rd person's point of view. Is there anything in your life you can improve or optimize? Sometimes you need to unlearn to make a progress.</p>\n<h3>\"Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it‚Äôs unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself ... The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.\"</h3>\n<p>Here's how to be the best version of yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You find a person who you want to be or an identity you want to acquire</li>\n<li>You mimic their habits associated with the new identity. If you want to lose weight, ask yourself \"what would a healthy person eat?\"</li>\n<li>You motivate yourself to stick with those new habits by telling yourself that you are like that person</li>\n<li>The new identity becomes part of you</li>\n<li>You continue your habits because that's <strong>what you do</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\"The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to eat healthier‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to write more,‚Äù but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will ‚Äújust remember to do it‚Äù or feel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like ‚ÄúI want to work out more‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to be more productive‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should vote‚Äù and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.\"</h3>\n<p>Make your plan actionable. Habit Stacking is powerful in this sense. When you want to start a new habit, you can tell yourself to do it after an already established habit.</p>\n<h3>\"If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don‚Äôt need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in ... Standardize before you optimize. You can‚Äôt improve a habit that doesn‚Äôt exist.\"</h3>\n<p>You start with quantity. Then you optimize it as you go.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/book-notes/atomic-habits","title":"Book Notes ‚Äî Atomic Habits","description":"This is my most favorite book so far.
