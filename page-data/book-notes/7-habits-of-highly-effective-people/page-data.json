I found this book similar to <em>How to Make Friends and Influence People</em>. In this book, Stephen Covey teaches you the idea of interdependency.</p>\n<h3>\"Nevertheless, the current social paradigm enthrones independence. It is the avowed goal of many individuals and social movements. Most of the self-improvement material puts independence on a pedestal, as though communication, teamwork, and cooperation were lesser values.\"</h3>\n<p>I found this quote very interesting because we value independence and not so much on cooperation in the US. But in Japan, it's exactly the opposite. They value cooperation, but not independence. I got to see both sides of the story, and they are both important. When we are both the independent and cooperative, we are <strong>interdependent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>\"As an interdependent person, I have the opportunity to share myself deeply, meaningfully, with others, and I have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings.\"</h3>\n<p>Stephen argues that we can't be interdependent without being independent first. This makes sense. Wihout anything to give, you can't expect to get something from others. This follows the principle of reciprocity.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Vision\"</h3>\n<p><em>Circle of influence</em> is the area of life you can make an influence. We can't control what other people do, but we can control what we do. For example, if you love someone, instead of sitting by and just saying you love them, show it with actions. Take initiative on things you can make an influence. The goal is to expand your circle of influence. The more things you can influence, the easier you can control your life.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind\"</h3>\n<p>What does this mean?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To Begin with the End in Mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction ... It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it's leaning against the wrong wall. It is possible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you hesitate to stick with your habit, it's nice to reflect the end goal the habit to help you achive. Think about the reason why you started the habit in the first place. A few minutes of medidation in the morning can help you do that. Medidation doesn't mean you need to sit still and close your eyes. You can simply sit on the chair, sip your monring cup of coffee, and reflect your goals with your eyes wide open.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 3: Put First Things First\"</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of topics to cover related to this habit. First off, a task can be categorized into one of these four categrories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quadrant I: Urgent and important task</li>\n<li>Quadrant II: Not urgent but important task</li>\n<li>Quadrant III: Urgent but not imporant task</li>\n<li>Quadrant IV: Not urgent and not important task</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We tend to react to urgent matters. Most likely we work on Quadrant I tasks then onto Quadrant III. But this never solves the problems fundamentally. We need to stop Quadrant II tasks from developing to Quadrant I tasks. The correct order of execution is I -> II -> III -> IV. We want to solve the problems from the roots and prevent them from becoming serious/urgent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many people seem to think that success in one area can compensate for failure in other areas of life. But can it really? Perhaps it can for a limited time in some areas. But can success in your profession compensate for a broken marriage, ruined health, or weakness in personal character? True effectiveness requires balance, and your tool needs to help you create and maintain it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been expending all my energy on academics over the last few years. I thought it was impossible to be social and maintain good grades at the same time. It's well known that you can only pick two out of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good Grades</li>\n<li>Social Life</li>\n<li>Enough Sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*8y_FvQPG8dRA_4HkM2hUZQ.jpeg\" alt=\"college life pick two\"></p>\n<p>But if I'm truly effective and manage my time efficiently, I should be able to do all three. Now that I've graduated from college, <em>Good Grades</em> becomes <em>Career</em>. I think I can apply 80/20 rule here -- 80% on Career and Enough Sleep, 20% on Social Life. I may not be progressing as fast as possible on my career, but at least I won't be miserable with my social life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort and they could do the job better themselves. But effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high-leverage activity there is. Transferring responsibility to other skilled and trained people enables you to give your energies to other high-leverage activities. Delegation means growth, both for individuals and for organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This delegation tip was also introduced in <em>Atomic Habits</em>. I believe the ultimate goal of life is to buy time with money. So if you can hire someone to do your job for you (of course, given that you can afford it financially), then you should.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The techniques and skills that really make a difference in human interaction are the ones that almost naturally flow from a truly independent character. So the place to begin building any relationship is inside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influence, our own character. As we become independent -- proactive, centered in correct principles, value driven and able to organize and execute around the priorities in our life with integrity -- we then can choose to become interdependent -- capable of building rich, enduring, highly productive relationships with other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's how I interpreted this quote: Being social and building a relationship with someone is like building the foundation for interdependence. You interact with someone and see if you can create a new value/perspective (i.e. synergy) together with them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor that describes the amount of trust that's been built up in a relationship. It's the feeling of safeness you have with another human being. If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, and keeping my commitments to you, I build up a reserve. Your trust toward me becomes higher, and I can call upon that trust many times if I need to. I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Doing someone a favor is like depositing into their Emotional Bank Account of you. Making a mistake is like withdrawing from the account (e.g. not keeping a promise). But make no mistake, asking someone for a favor is not a withdrawal. When you ask someone for a favor, you give them an opportunity to deposit into your Emotional Bank Account of them. Whether they do your favor or not depends on the balance you have on the their Emotional Bank Account of you. The more difficult the favor, the larger the balance it requires.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 4: Think Win-Win\"</h3>\n<p>Win-win is the core of public victory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Public Victory does not mean victory over other people. It means success in effective interaction that brings mutually beneficial results to everyone involved. Public Victory means working together, communicating together, making things happen together that even the same people couldn't make happen by working independently. And Public Victory is an outgrowth of the Abundance Mentality paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To achive win-win, you need to think hard. Very hard. We all tend to go for win-lose (i.e. you win they lose), but this is not sustainable.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood\"</h3>\n<p>We typically don't listen to what people say until we think they truly understand our emotions/situations.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 6: Synergize\"</h3>\n<p>This is an extension of win-win.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you see only two alternatives -- yours and the “wrong” one -- you can look for a synergistic Third Alternative. There's almost always a Third Alternative, and if you work with a win-win philosophy and really seek to understand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for everyone concerned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seek for the third alternative. Most of the time, there is one.</p>\n<h3>\"Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw\"</h3>\n<p>Review your daily tasks. Optimize what you can. Specifically, you can mediate every morning to relect your life -- appreciate what you've achived and recalibrate your trajectory toward your goals.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-notes/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3361508366"]}
