Below is the list of quotes that stuck with my heart.</p>\n<h2>\"Employer pays more for the ability to deal with people over the technical ability in engineering.\"</h2>\n<p>This explains why engineering managers generally earns more than engineers. A manager's job is to encourage the engineers to perform to their maximum potentials, and that requires the ability to handle people. During one of my summer internships, I remember my manager frequently praised me for doing such an amazing work and told me keep up with it. He enlightened my day. It encouraged me to do better and provide the best I can. This is not an easy thing to do. He showed his appreciation natually and sincerely. I would need time and experience socializing with people to acquire this skill.</p>\n<h2>\"If you teach a man anything, he will never learn. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing.\"</h2>\n<p>I think the university courses contributed to my learnings <em>indirectly</em>. I usually find myself lost and overwhelmed with jargons I've never heard of in classes. But still I was able to ace the class by the end of the quarter. Thinking back now, here's why I think I've been doing well academically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever I don't understand something, I would Google it. This is super efficient because most of the time you will get what you want within minutes.</li>\n<li>If I can't find the answer online, I post the questions on Piazza. But I don't expect to get an answer here. Piazza is just a question bank where I accumulate my questions.</li>\n<li>During the office hours, I ask questions I posted on Piazza if they are not answered already.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see here, bulk of the learnings are initiated by me and not the school. Schools are there to tell you where to start. You are the one responsible for digging in deeper.</p>\n<h2>\"Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.\"</h2>\n<p>Criticizing someone will only make them try to rationalize their decisions. Next time when you are tempted to criticize someone, put yourself in your own shoes, and think about whey they did what they did. Everyone does a thing with a reason.</p>\n<h2>\"Give honest and sincere appreciation.\"</h2>\n<p>Anything you do is for the desire to be great. I started to exercise because I wanted to be an attractive man. I started reading books to improve my life. I started to learn about productivity so I can do more in a day. I started investment so I can make more money and be financially successful. I bought a bike so I can be mobile and save time.</p>\n<p>Conversely, everyone else is craving for approval/appreciation. So no matter how small it is, when someone does something for you, show your gratitude. That gives them a feel of importance. A little harsh, but if you can't even spare a little time doing this, don't expect anyone to appreciate you.</p>\n<h2>\"Arouse in the other person an eager want.\"</h2>\n<p>The best way to have someone do something for you, is to make them want to do it. Next time you want to persuade someboday to do something, think how you can make them want to do it. For example, if you want to get a discount for your rent, think about what makes the landlord want to give you a discount. Here's what you can do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just ask for 5% - 10% discount directly mentioning how good your credit score is. From the landlord's perspective, they would rather have someone pay rent on time with slightly cheaper price than having tenants not paying their rents on time with higher price.</li>\n<li>Move-in sooner for a discount. As a landlord, they want to fill in the vacancy as soon as possible to save their money.</li>\n<li>Ask for free first month rent. From the landlord's point of view, they get the asking price they want.</li>\n<li>Pre-pay first 3 months rent. Give the landlord a piece of mind that you are financially stable to pay rent on time.</li>\n<li>Lock in a long term lease rate. If you are sure you will be living there for a long time, sign a 2-year lease to prevent the inflation from bumping up the rent after the first year. Again from the landlord's perspective, they will save time/effort to find a tenant for your spot for at lease 2 years.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Cited from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8zc2AvYqcE&#x26;ab_channel=GrahamStephan\">7 TRICKS: How To Save A TON Of Money When Renting A Home</a>)</p>\n<h2>\"Become genuinely interested in other people.\"</h2>\n<p>We think about ourselves 95% of our time. We find joy talking about ourselves because we are the most important thing to think about. So naturally we like people who are interested in us. In return, we like to learn more about the people who are interested in us. To be interesting, be interested in others.</p>\n<h2>\"Smile.\"</h2>\n<p>Your smile makes you approachable. Why does everyone like babies? Because they smile.</p>\n<h2>\"Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\"</h2>\n<p>Make sure you remember people's name.</p>\n<h2>\"Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\"</h2>\n<p>Again people are interested in themselves the most. To make a conversation, talk about <em>them</em> rather than you.</p>\n<h2>\"Philosophy of Appreciation\"</h2>\n<p>Be polite when asking for something. Remember, nobody gives a fork about you. So when someone does something for you, that's a special thing. Use phrases like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm sorry to touble you but ...</li>\n<li>Would you be kind to ...</li>\n<li>Would you mind ...</li>\n<li>Would you please ...</li>\n<li>Thank you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>to show them the courtesies.</p>\n<h2>\"Almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way.\"</h2>\n<p>Conversely, everyone I meet is superior to me in some way, from which I can learn something from them and thus should respect them.</p>\n<h2>\"Welcome the disagreement\"</h2>\n<p>When someone disagrees with you, it hurts your feelings. Don't! Be thankful that it's brought to your attention. It could be an opportunity for you to correct your mistake.</p>\n<h2>\"The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\"</h2>\n<p>What if you are the one that disgrees with them? Carnegie argues that you should not prove they are wrong. Instead, suggest the mistakes/solutions subtly. Let the them feel that the idea is theirs.</p>\n<h2>\"Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.\"</h2>\n<p>99% of the other person is same as you. If they have some ideas or desires that disagree with yours, respect them. If you were in their shoes, you would probably have thought the same way.</p>\n<h2>\"A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.\"</h2>\n<p>Ah this is so true. For instance, when people ask why I chose Computer Science (CS) as my major, I tell them it's because I liked math and Computer Science is an application of math. In reality, I chose CS for no reason. I was about to be a college student, so I had to pick a major. Browing the web was one of the most frequent things I do at that time and CS seemed somewhat relevant. That was it üòõ. Fortunately, it's fun and I like it.</p>\n<h2>\"Dramatize your ideas\"</h2>\n<p>The same idea, depending on how you present it, can bring different impacts on the listeners. For example, instead of saying <code>I changed a lightbulb</code>, you could say <code>I performed necessary upkeep and maintenance on electrical illumination system and instituted positive change in workplace efficiency</code>.</p>\n<p>(Cited from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d1cqdv/how_would_you_write_i_changed_a_lightbulb_on_your/\">How would you write \"I changed a lightbulb\" on your resume?</a>)</p>\n<h2>\"Throw down a challenge.\"</h2>\n<p>Deep inside we all have this desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance. I'm glad I'm a UCLA student because I'm surrounded by amazing students, and they constantly stimulate my desire to excel them.</p>\n<h2>\"Begin with praise and honest appreciation.\"</h2>\n<p>There is one time in a code review, I noticed there were not only comments about fixes, but there were also some little praises like <code>üëç</code> and <code>Good job!</code>. This was really nice because it makes you feel less sad when they tell you something needs a fix.</p>\n<h2>\"Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\"</h2>\n<p>This advice is especially applicable when you criticize someone younger than you. Think about yourself at their ages. You probably would have made the same mistakes because you wouldn't have had the experience.</p>\n<h2>\"Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.\"</h2>\n<p>One time in a code review, instead of directly pointing out the mistakes, I mentioned whether an edge case like so and so would cause an issue. This would indirectly mention their mistake and have them solve it by themselves, and they would think the idea is theirs.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/book-notes/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people","title":"Book Notes: How to Win Friends and Influence People"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-notes/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3361508366"]}
