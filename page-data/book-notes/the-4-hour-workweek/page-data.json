As shown in \"How to win friends and influence people,\" we are all craving for the feel of importance. Do what you are proud of. Having nothing to do is poisonous.</p>\n<h2>\"The NR aims to distribute 'mini-retirements' throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool’s gold of retirement.\"</h2>\n<p>Can your work done remotely? If you are self-employed, you can do this easily.</p>\n<h2>\"The Timing Is Never Right.\"</h2>\n<p>The world is not built around you. Don't wait for the right time because it's never right. Do it now!</p>\n<h2>\"Conditions are never perfect. 'Someday' is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it 'eventually,' just do it and correct course along the way.\"</h2>\n<p>This idea is similar to writing a program. You get started by writing crappy code, then refine and optimize them as you go.</p>\n<h2>\"Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do.\"</h2>\n<p>Again, do what you want to do. Of course, you need to work to pay the bills. But think outside the box. Can your work be something you like?</p>\n<h2>\"There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphoria and its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria.\"</h2>\n<p>Dysphoria is defined as \"a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.\" This is actually good for you. It puts you in a state of mind to look for improvements in your life. I often feel this type of stress when reading self improvement books including \"The 4-hour Workweek.\"</p>\n<h2>\"As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear.\"</h2>\n<p>I believe this is because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success takes risks.</li>\n<li>The more challenge you resolve, the more difficult your next challenge becomes. Basically you are upgrading your risk tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\"Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract 'failure'.\"</h2>\n<p>It's okay to fail. But don't get bored and have nothing to do. Inaction is the enemy.</p>\n<h2>\"I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing action.\"</h2>\n<p>Yes, yes and yes. I've wanted to horn my English speaking skills as one of my long term goal, but haven't spent much time on it. I don't think the issue is because the goal is long term. The problem is that the goal is <strong>abstract</strong>. I need to chop this goal into bite-size chunks I can accomplish in a short period of time, something like \"memorize more vocabularies\" or \"shadow lines from TV shows.\"</p>\n<h2>\"Being selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.\"</h2>\n<p>This is known as 80/20 principle, which states that 80% of the result comes from 20% of the cause. For example, I took many CS classes at UCLA, but I probably only use 20% of the knowledge for the work. So in my free time, I take Udemy online courses directly related to my work such as Web Application, GraphQL, and Infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>\"Lack of time is actually lack of priorities.\"</h2>\n<p>When you want to try something new, be it going to a gym, reading books, or taking an online class, you might think, \"But, I don't have time for that.\" Wrong. We always have time. Here's how to produce more time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prioritize the tasks</strong>: I also have lots of things to work on—doing my homework, preparing for exams, exercise, reading books, attending lectures, taking Udemy courses, go grocery, making a game, etc. How should I manage to handle all these? I prioritize the tasks. I really want to read books, taking Udemy class, and exercise every single day. So I preallocate specific slots for them. I must read a book 8AM-9AM. I must exercise 3PM-4PM. I must watch Udemy online course 9PM-10PM. When the times comes, stop whatever you are doing now, and start what you said you would do. You are probably thinking, \"But what about the homework? I also need to go grocery or I will starve!\" Check the next tip.</li>\n<li><strong>Allocate less time on a task</strong>: You can actually complete a task faster than you think. Following the 80/20 principle, 20% of your time spent on homework contributes 80% of the progress. Just like short term goal is easier to accomplish than long term goal, when you have less time to do your homework, you think harder. Your brain tries to figure out the most efficient way to complete your homework on time. Don't study hard, but study smart.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\"Being Effective vs. Being Efficient\"</h2>\n<p>Being efficient is important, but being effective is more important. Take grocery shopping as an example. You might find the fastest bike route to Trader Joe's from your home. But if you are going shopping every day, then the net time you saved isn't much. Instead, if you find a way to go grocery shopping only once a week (I ask my roommate to invite me when he goes grocerry shopping. I don't have a car but he has a car.), you save <strong>much more</strong> time. Before you optimize/automate/streadmline a task, see if you can <strong>eliminate</strong> the task all together.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/book-notes/the-4-hour-workweek","title":"Book Notes: The 4-Hour Workweek","description":"In this book, Tim Ferriss introduces the idea of NR (New Rich) and how to live like a millionaire without a million dollars.","thumbnailUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563861826100-9cb868fdbe1c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-notes/the-4-hour-workweek"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3361508366"]}
