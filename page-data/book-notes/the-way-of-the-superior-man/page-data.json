Although most of the topics discussed were irrelevant to me, he proposed some interesting ideas worth noting.</p>\n<h3>\"Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity, which is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles.\"</h3>\n<p>The more masculine energy you have, the more you are attracted by people with feminine energy. You must have a mission. A mission is the core of masculine energy. On the other hand, intimate relationships are the core of feminine energy.</p>\n<p>My mission is to be a millionaire by age 30 ðŸ˜Ž.</p>\n<h3>\"Lean just beyond your edge\"</h3>\n<p>We all tend to settle down in our comfort zone. But without a change, there is no improvement. We are so afraid of failure and stop trying new things. Try to be 1% better every day. Put yourself just so slightly into uncomfortable situtation.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/book-notes/the-way-of-the-superior-man"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3361508366"]}
